# Codsoft_Moving_Rating_Prediction_Python_ML

🎬 Movie Rating Prediction with Python
This project aims to predict IMDb ratings of Indian movies using features such as Genre, Director, and Actors. By analyzing historical movie data, we build a regression model that estimates how a movie might be rated by users or critics.

🔍 Project Highlights
Objective: Predict IMDb ratings based on categorical features like genre, director, and lead actors.

Model Used: Linear Regression

Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle (Indian IMDb Movies Dataset)

🧠 Key Concepts Explored
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Engineering & One-Hot Encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations

Regression Modeling using Scikit-learn

Model Evaluation using MSE and R² Score

🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset Features
Column	Description
Genre	Movie genres (comma-separated values)
Director	Movie director's name
Star1-3	Lead and supporting actors
Rating	IMDb rating (target variable)

📈 Model Results
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 8.14

R² Score: -3.37 (indicating poor prediction accuracy due to high variance in categorical features)
